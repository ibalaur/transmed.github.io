# Description 

Knowledge-based translational medicine is a rapidly growing discipline in biomedical research and aims to expedite the discovery of new diagnostic tools and treatments by using a multi-disciplinary, highly collaborative, "bench-to-bedside" approach. Large amounts of multi-omics, imaging (medical and molecular) and clinical data can now be captured for given patient populations. In addition to the challenges of data curation and harmonisation, new computational methods are required to identify molecular signatures that suggest disease subtype. These signatures may be predictive of outcome or progression, and impact on disease management by suggesting personalised therapeutic strategies for patients. Such approaches will further the development of a new taxonomy of disease.

In the TransMed COSI meeting, we will explore the current status of computational biology approaches within the field of translational medicine.

Keynote title: 20 Challenges of AI in Medicine

Abstract: The opportunities for using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to improve healthcare are endless. Recent successes include the use of deep learning to identify clinically important patterns in radiographic images. However, there are numerous important challenges which must be addressed before AI can become widely adopted and incorporated into clinical workflows. Some of these challenges come from healthcare data. For example, clinical data from electronic health records (EHR) are notoriously noisy and incomplete. Some of these challenges come from the limitations of AI algorithms. For example, each algorithm looks at data in a different manner. How do you know which are the right methods to employ for a given data set? We will review 10 important clinical data challenges and 10 AI challenges which can impede progress in this area. A number of specific examples and some possible solutions will be provided.
